# TODO solution
- [ ] provide zip of each service built by CI, in packages
- [ ] add in description mention of 3 frameworks
- [ ] URL -> host in outputs

- [ ] Add correlation ID in logs (Dapr?)

## Nice to have
- [ ] devcontainer with vscode extensions (what's missing? Db explorer?)
- [c] cosmosdb emulator in compose file? 
- [ ] secrets bash array with newlines -> nope? ask Chris
- [ ] env file uppercase
- [ ] URLs and DB CS in format <name>_URL
- [ ] bash strict mode

# Workshop
<!-- - [ ] Event Grid to pass events -->
<!-- - [ ] Azure Function to process events and store in DB -->
<!-- * [ ] Service to service communication/auth -->
  * Service discovery?
  * Logging/Tracing

- [ ] website nice CSS?

# Plan

0. Setup
  - VSCode
  - Docker
  - devcontainer (Node, Azure CLI, Bicep, Extensions)
  - install nest/fastify/express CLIs
  - github account (azure later!)

1. Intro
  - goal
  - architecture (+ détaillée avec services azure en vrai)

             (express)         (nestjs)
  webapp -> API Gateway |--> Dice rolls API ---------> CosmosDB
                        |    
                        |--> Settings API -----------> CosmosDB
                             (fastify + az sdk)
  - explain basics SWA (+auth) + Containers (ACA)

2. UserSettings API (fastify)
  - create mock DB and service (in memory + simulated delay)
  - PUT /settings/{user_id} { dice_faces: 6 }
  - GET /settings/{user_id}
  - test with REST client/curl
  - Dockerfile
  - test

3. Dice API (nestjs)
  - create mock DB and service (in memory + simulated delay)
  - POST /rolls { dice_faces: } => { result: 4 } + store in DB (w/ date + faces)
  - GET  /rolls/history?count=50&dice_faces=6 => { result: [2, 4, 6] }
  - test with REST client/curl
  - Dockerfile with Docker build
  - test

4. API Gateway (express)
  - need auth header with user_id (from SWA) => middleware
  - PUT /settings/
  - GET /settings/
  - POST /rolls { count: 100 } => get settings + N calls to Dice API
    => { result: 4, duration: XX (in ms) }
  - GET  /rolls/history?count=50 => get settings + call to Dice API
    => { result: [2, 4, 6] }
  - test with REST client/curl
  - Dockerfile
  - Docker compose to run all yml
  - test

5. WebApp (pure HTML/JS) with ugly/no CSS :)
  - Start from template!
  - Introduce SWA + CLI
  - Connect auth for github login
  - Set dice type preference (call PUT /settings)
  - Roll N dices and show results / time
  - Show last N rolls

6. Creating Azure Infra
  - Setup azure account
  - Explain SWA / ACR / ACA / CosmosDB
  - Explain IaC / Bicep
  - Use provided Bicep templates + AZ CLI command to create infra
  - Explain some of the setup: gateway public, other microservices private, SWA API proxy...

7. Connect Cosmos Databases
  - provide connection string in env + adapt code for Settings API
  - provide connection string in env + adapt code for Dice API
  - test locally
  - look in data explorer

8. Deploy with CI/CD
  - Explain GitHub actions
  - Create Azure SP + add secrets
  - Create GHA workflow
  - Deploy
  - test

9. Monitoring and scaling
  - Create dashboard cpu/memory
  - test with 100, 1k, 10k rolls -> view graphs
  - review ACA scaling rules -> change with AZ CLI
  - test again -> view graphs

10. Logging and tracing
  - connect to Dice API logs with AZ CLI
  - explain app/system logs
  - explain why tracing (N calls, from which request?)
  - create log analytics request to trace all requests from api gateway call

11. conclusion!
  - clean up infra
