# ‚òÅÔ∏è nodejs-microservices

Discover the fundamentals of microservices architecture and how to implement them from code to production, using Node.js, Docker and Azure. You'll use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) to build 3 microservices, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to create the web interface of our application.

üëâ [See the workshop](https://aka.ms/ws/node-microservices)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v20+
- Docker v20+
- An Azure account ([sign up for free here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-yolasors))

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to work on this project directly from your browser: select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab and click on **Create Codespaces on main**.

You can also use the [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) to work locally using a ready-to-use dev environment.

## Project details

This project is structured as monorepo and makes use of [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces).

Here's the application architecture schema:

## How to run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This command will use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to instantiate the 3 services, along with the [Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli/) emulator to run the website and authentication server.

The application will then be available at http://localhost:4280.

## How to build Docker images

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

This command will build the container images for all 3 services.

## How to setup deployment

```bash
./azure/setup.sh
```

This command will ask you to log in into Azure and GitHub, then set up the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` repository secrets for deployment.
